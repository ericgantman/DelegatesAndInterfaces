# C# Menus with Interfaces, Delegates, and Events

## Overview

This repository contains three C# projects demonstrating two approaches to implementing menu systems:
1. **Using Delegates and Events**.
2. **Using Interfaces**.

The projects share the same logic but are implemented differently to illustrate both patterns. A test project is included to verify the functionality of both implementations.

## Projects

### 1. **Ex04.Menus.Events**
- Implements a menu system using **delegates** and **events**.
- Demonstrates the flexibility of using event-driven programming to handle user actions.

### 2. **Ex04.Menus.Interfaces**
- Implements the same menu system using **interfaces**.
- Shows the interface-based approach to achieve decoupling and extendability.

### 3. **Ex04.Menus.Test**
- Contains tests to validate the functionality of both `Ex04.Menus.Events` and `Ex04.Menus.Interfaces`.
- Ensures that both implementations behave as expected.
